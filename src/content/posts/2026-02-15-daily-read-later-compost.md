I have a confession that will surprise absolutely nobody: I have a read‑later list.

Not *a* read‑later list, actually. A hydra of read‑later lists.

- A browser folder called “Articles”
- A second folder called “Articles (Actually Read)” (a cruel joke)
- A handful of “tabs I’ll get back to” that have achieved geological age
- A notes app page titled “Links” with the vibes of an attic

If you’re nodding along, you already know the punchline: saved links pile up faster than we can read them, and the pile quietly turns into a background stressor.

So here’s my current take: **a read‑later list is not a library. It’s a conveyor belt.** If you don’t decide what happens at the end of the belt, you’ll eventually be living inside the warehouse.

This post is a small, practical system to *compost* the pile—turn it into something useful, or into nothing at all (which is also useful).

## Why read‑later lists rot

Read‑later tools are frictionless, and frictionless is dangerous.

Saving a link feels like taking action. It scratches the itch of “I should know this” without requiring the actual work of reading. The list grows; the guilt grows; and the next time you see an interesting link, your brain goes: “Don’t worry, Future Me has this covered.”

Future Me is exhausted.

There’s also a deeper thing happening: saved links are a form of **attention debt**. You borrowed a little mental relief (“I won’t forget”) and agreed to pay interest later (“I really should read those…”).

Herbert A. Simon put it cleanly: “*a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention*.” (Source: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy#Herbert_Simon>)

In other words, your list isn’t just a queue. It’s competing for a scarce resource.

## The goal: fewer saved links, more finished thoughts

I’m not trying to become a monk who reads only papyrus scrolls and stares meaningfully into the middle distance.

The goal is simpler:

1. **Turn some links into *finished thoughts*** (notes, experiments, decisions)
2. **Delete the rest without guilt**

A read‑later list that only ever grows is just procrastination with better UX.

## The composting system (20 minutes, once a week)

Pick a cadence you can actually keep. Weekly is ideal. Monthly also works if you accept that your list will resemble an archeological dig.

Set a timer for **20 minutes**. Not because 20 is magic, but because it’s short enough that you won’t negotiate with yourself all day.

Then do this:

### Step 1: Create three buckets

You can do this in your read‑later app, a note, a text file—wherever. The buckets matter more than the tool.

- **Do** (things that change your behavior)
- **Make** (things that produce something)
- **Delete** (everything else)

The trick is that **“Read” is not a bucket**.

Reading is a *means*, not an outcome. Outcomes are what keep the list from becoming an afterlife.

Examples:

- **Do:** “Try that keyboard shortcut,” “Change my backup schedule,” “Stop using that one setting that keeps biting me.”
- **Make:** “Write a 200‑word note,” “Build a tiny demo,” “Add a snippet to my dotfiles,” “Draft a blog idea.”
- **Delete:** “Interesting, but not for me,” “I already know this,” “I won’t act on this,” “I saved this during a caffeine event.”

### Step 2: Triage with a brutal question

For each link, ask:

> If I read this, what will I *do differently* this week?

If the honest answer is “nothing,” you have permission to delete it.

This sounds harsh, but it’s actually kind. You’re not deleting knowledge; you’re deleting a promise you don’t intend to keep.

### Step 3: Limit the “Do” and “Make” piles

Hard cap them.

- **Do:** max **5**
- **Make:** max **3**

Why so small? Because these are commitments. A big “Do” pile is just a new form of guilt.

If you find yourself wanting to keep more, it’s a sign the links are not the issue. Your *priorities* are.

### Step 4: Convert one link into a finished artifact (right now)

Before the timer ends, pick **one** link from “Make” and produce a tiny artifact:

- a few bullet notes
- a small code snippet
- a checklist
- a single paragraph summary
- a question you want to explore

Don’t aim for a masterpiece. Aim for evidence of digestion.

This is the composting part: the value is in the transformation.

## The “good enough” note format

If you want a template, here’s one that keeps things moving:

- **What is it?** (one sentence)
- **Why did I save it?** (one sentence)
- **One idea worth keeping** (bullet)
- **One action** (bullet)
- **One link back** (URL)

That’s it. If you do this consistently, you’ll end up with a small collection of *usable* notes instead of a sprawling list of *potential* knowledge.

## The two kinds of links worth saving

After a while, I’ve noticed that most links I save fall into two categories:

### 1) Reference links (the “manuals”)

These are things you’ll want to look up when you’re actively doing the work:

- API docs
- setup guides
- a specific technical explanation
- a product page you’re comparing

These are fine. They’re not “read later.” They’re “consult when needed.” Store them accordingly.

### 2) Inspiration links (the “sparks”)

These are things that make you want to build, write, or think:

- a cool demo
- an essay that reframes something
- a weird Internet artifact

These should generally be composted quickly. Inspiration has a half‑life.

If you don’t convert the spark into something within a week or two, it becomes… decorative guilt.

## A word on FOMO (and deleting with pride)

Deleting a link can feel like admitting you’ll never become the person who reads it.

That’s the point.

The secret is: **you’re already becoming a person.** You are becoming the person defined by what you repeatedly do, not what you repeatedly save.

If you need a mantra, try:

- “Saved isn’t solved.”
- “Bookmarks are not achievements.”
- “My attention is a budget, not a vending machine.”

Also: sometimes you should delete links *because they worked*. You read it, got the idea, and you’re done. Don’t keep receipts for every thought you ever had.

## Tools don’t fix this (but one useful link anyway)

This isn’t a “use app X” post, because apps mostly help you save faster.

That said, if you want to go deeper on the underlying concept—attention as a scarce resource—the broader idea of an **attention economy** is worth a read: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy>

Not because Wikipedia will change your life, but because it gives language to the feeling that the Internet is always asking for more than you can pay.

## The punchline

A read‑later list can be a calm promise to your future self.

Or it can be a tiny, persistent “you’re behind” machine.

The difference is whether you treat it like a conveyor belt with an end.

So this week, set a 20‑minute timer, make three buckets, and compost the pile:

- Keep a few commitments
- Convert one into an artifact
- Delete the rest

Future You doesn’t need a bigger list.

Future You needs fewer open loops.
