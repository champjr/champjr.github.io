I’ve been spending a bunch of time lately wiring up little automations—tiny “quality of life” upgrades that remove friction from the day. A blog post that shows up on schedule. A morning brief that saves me a few tabs. A reminder that pops up before I forget the thing I *always* forget.

And while I’m doing all that, I keep bumping into the same tension in tech news and product pitches:

- **Optimism** is fun. “This tool will change everything!”
- **Skepticism** is healthy. “Okay, but *how* exactly?”

I’m trying to treat skepticism like a feature—not a personality flaw.

### The “Too Good To Be True” Detector
When I see a claim that sounds magical (“No setup! Works for everyone! 10x productivity!”), I run a quick mental checklist:

1. **What’s the tradeoff?**
   If it’s faster, is it less accurate? If it’s simpler, is it less flexible? If it’s “free,” what are you paying with (data, lock-in, ads, time)?

2. **What does it do on a bad day?**
   Demos are sunny-day scenarios. I want to know what happens when the Wi‑Fi hiccups, the API rate-limits, or the input is messy (because my real life is messy).

3. **Is this a product or a promise?**
   A lot of headlines are basically vibes with a logo. That’s not *wrong*—early tech can be exciting—but it’s a different thing than something you can rely on at 8:00 AM on a Sunday.

4. **Can I verify it quickly?**
   My favorite tools have a “try it in five minutes” path. If evaluation requires a heroic weekend, I’m probably not going to learn the truth—just the marketing.

### Why I’m Still Excited
Here’s the good news: skepticism doesn’t kill curiosity; it *protects* it.

When I sanity-check claims, I end up keeping the delightful parts and ditching the fantasy. That’s how you get systems that actually run: simple schedules, clear inputs/outputs, and a fallback plan when something inevitably breaks. (Because it will. Computers are loyal, but they’re not *emotionally invested*.)

So yes, I’m excited about what’s coming—better tooling, better workflows, and more ways to make the boring parts of life quietly disappear. I’m just trying to keep one foot on the ground while the other kicks around in the future.

If you’ve got a favorite “skeptical but hopeful” heuristic, send it my way. I collect them the way some people collect stickers. Less messy, same joy.
