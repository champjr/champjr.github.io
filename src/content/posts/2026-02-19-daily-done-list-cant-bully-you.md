To-do lists have a very specific talent: **they can make you feel behind while you’re actively doing the work.**

You can finish five meaningful things before lunch, glance at a to-do list that still looks like a CVS receipt, and immediately conclude you are failing at being a person.

That’s not a moral failing on your part. It’s a design property of the tool.

A to-do list is an inventory of *uncompleted intentions*. It is, by definition, a list of the stuff you haven’t done yet.

So here’s a small counter-spell I keep coming back to:

## Keep a “done list”

A done list starts empty. As you do things, you write them down.

That’s it. No app required. No template. No streak. No dopamine casino.

The point isn’t to replace your to-do list forever (to-dos are useful!). The point is to balance the ledger.

Because most of us are walking around with a brain that’s really good at:

- remembering what we *still* need to do
- forgetting what we *already* did

Which is a great recipe for motivation problems.

If you want a longer explanation from someone smarter and calmer than me, Oliver Burkeman has a great short piece advocating for done lists: <https://www.oliverburkeman.com/donelist>

## Why it works (even when nothing else does)

A done list is a tiny instrument panel.

Not the kind that nags you (“you have 17 overdue items!”), but the kind that tells you the truth: **the day isn’t disappearing into a void; it’s turning into output.**

To-do lists are forward-looking. Done lists are evidence.

And evidence matters because modern work is full of tasks that are real, necessary, and oddly invisible:

- replying to a tricky email
- unblocking someone
- reading a doc so you can make a decision
- fixing something so it doesn’t break again
- doing the annoying-but-important admin thing

These aren’t “moving boxes from point A to point B” tasks. They’re more like “hold the entire system together with your hands” tasks.

A to-do list doesn’t always capture those well. A done list catches them automatically.

## The done list is especially good for knowledge work

A lot of knowledge work looks like nothing from the outside.

If you’re writing, coding, designing, researching, or planning, you can spend three hours on something and end up with:

- a sentence you finally like
- a bug that’s no longer there
- a plan that is 20% smaller and 80% better

From the outside: “what did you *do* today?”

From the inside: you fought a small dragon and won.

A done list is how you keep receipts for those wins.

## How I actually do it (in a way that survives reality)

The easiest done list is a plain text note titled something like:

**`Done — 2026-02-19`**

Then you just add bullets. Examples:

- shipped the draft
- scheduled the call
- fixed the broken test
- made the page load 30% faster (measured)
- bought the thing we were out of

A few practical rules that make it stick:

### 1) Include “invisible” tasks on purpose

If you did it and it mattered, it counts.

- “Had a hard conversation” counts.
- “Clarified requirements so we don’t build the wrong thing” counts.
- “Stopped doing a thing that wasn’t working” definitely counts.

It’s called a done list, not a “things that look impressive on LinkedIn” list.

### 2) Write the item *after* you finish it

This sounds obvious, but it’s the whole point.

To-do lists are promises. Done lists are history.

If you write something down early, your brain will preemptively spend the satisfaction. It’ll feel *kind of* done, and then you’ll wonder why you lost momentum.

So: do the thing, then record it.

### 3) Use the smallest unit that feels honest

If you make the done list too granular, it turns into a parody:

- opened laptop
- drank water
- responded to message

If you make it too big, it becomes discouraging:

- “Finish project”

The sweet spot is “a meaningful chunk of effort.”

If you’re not sure, try writing down the thing in a way that would make sense to Future You scanning it next week.

### 4) Don’t polish it

A done list is not a journal. It’s not a performance.

Leave typos. Use fragments. Let it be messy.

This is where the done list beats most productivity systems: it’s resilient. It doesn’t collapse when you don’t have time to be “consistent.”

## A done list doesn’t replace planning (it replaces shame)

The most common objection is: “But I need a to-do list to make sure I don’t forget things.”

Correct.

This is not an either/or. It’s a pairing:

- **To-do list:** what you intend to do
- **Done list:** what you actually did

That difference is where learning lives.

If you keep both for a week, you start noticing useful truths:

- You consistently underestimate how long certain tasks take.
- Meetings and interruptions eat a predictable chunk of time.
- Some “quick tasks” are actually emotional tasks.
- A few recurring problems are stealing your attention.

A to-do list helps you plan. A done list helps you calibrate.

## A fun side effect: it makes better retrospectives

If you’ve ever been asked “what did you accomplish this sprint/month/quarter?” and felt your mind go blank, you’ve experienced the deep unreliability of memory.

A done list turns that question into a quick scan.

It also makes it easier to:

- write weekly reviews
- prep for 1:1s
- build a brag doc (if you’re into that)
- notice patterns in your energy and focus

You don’t need to turn it into a formal process. Just having the raw material is already a win.

## The punchline

To-do lists are excellent servants and terrible bosses.

A done list is a way to keep your tools in their place.

It won’t magically create time. It won’t solve procrastination. It won’t file your taxes.

But it will do something surprisingly powerful: **it will prove to you that you’re not stuck.**

And on the days when everything feels like a treadmill, that proof is worth more than another perfectly optimized list of things you haven’t done yet.
