Some people do big, dramatic life overhauls.

I do something much less cinematic: I get annoyed, and then I try to make the annoyance stop happening again.

Not the *existential* annoyances. Not “the state of the world.” I mean the small, stupid stuff:

- A charger that only works if you hold it like you’re defusing a bomb.
- A folder full of screenshots named `Screen Shot 2026-02-20 at 9.17.03 AM.png` (a classic work of modern poetry).
- A recurring task that’s always “easy,” but somehow never gets done.
- A daily workflow that has one extra click, one extra confirmation dialog, one extra tiny “ugh.”

I’ve started calling this habit the **1% friction audit**.

The idea is simple:

1. Notice one bit of friction you hit repeatedly.
2. Fix it in a way Future You will actually feel.
3. Don’t take on a whole renovation project. Just sand one rough edge.

It’s not glamorous. It doesn’t photograph well. But it compounds like interest—quietly and relentlessly.

## What “friction” really is (in practice)

Friction is any tiny cost that turns “I should do that” into “I’ll do that later.”

It’s rarely the *hard part* of the work.

It’s the setup:

- The document template you have to hunt down.
- The login you can’t remember.
- The “where did I put that file?” scavenger hunt.
- The emotional speed bump of opening an app that greets you with chaos.

The point of an audit isn’t to become a monk who never feels inconvenience. The point is to **stop paying the same tiny tax every day**.

If you’ve ever tidied a desk and suddenly felt like you gained 20 minutes of life back, you’ve felt this.

## The audit: a tiny checklist that works

When you hit an “ugh” moment, run a quick mental prompt:

- **Does this happen more than once a week?** (If yes, it’s worth attention.)
- **Is the fix under 30 minutes?** (If no, turn it into a task, not a “quick win.”)
- **Can I remove a step instead of optimizing it?** (Deletion beats improvement.)

Then pick one of these four moves.

### 1) Delete the step

The best workflow is the one with fewer steps.

Examples:

- Stop copying/pasting a link between apps; use a share sheet, a shortcut, or an automation.
- Stop maintaining two lists that are basically the same list.
- Stop “saving it for later” in three different places (browser bookmarks, notes, a chat thread) and pick one.

Deletion feels like cheating because it is.

### 2) Make the right action the default

Defaults are incredibly persuasive.

If your default note opens to an empty page titled “Untitled,” you’ll collect “Untitled” notes like a raccoon collects shiny objects.

A few good defaults:

- A daily note template that already contains headings you actually use.
- A project folder that already has `notes.md`, `links.md`, and `decisions.md`.
- A to-do list that starts with the *next physical action*, not a vague aspiration.

This isn’t about productivity theater. It’s about putting the first stepping stone in the river.

### 3) Reduce the “activation energy”

There’s a useful behavior model called the **Fogg Behavior Model**, which (roughly) says behavior happens when motivation, ability, and a prompt converge. If you can’t reliably increase motivation, you can often increase ability by making the behavior easier.

Source: BJ Fogg’s overview of the model: https://behaviormodel.org/

You don’t have to become a motivational wizard. You can just lower the threshold.

Examples:

- Keep a “scratchpad” note pinned so you don’t have to decide where a thought goes.
- Put the *good* snacks at eye level.
- If you keep skipping a workout, shrink it to ten minutes. Your brain is more willing to start something that doesn’t look like a negotiation.

The goal is not to trick yourself. It’s to remove the need for a pep talk.

### 4) Make it harder to do the thing you regret

This is the evil twin of activation energy, and it’s incredibly effective.

Add friction to your worst autopilots:

- Log out of the app you mindlessly open.
- Move the icon off your home screen.
- Turn off the notifications that act like little tap-on-the-shoulder salespeople.

I’m not anti-fun. I’m anti-“I opened this and lost 40 minutes without consenting.”

## A few high-leverage friction fixes (steal these)

Here are fixes that tend to pay off disproportionately.

### Rename your “inbox” into something you’ll respect

If you have a folder, list, or note called “inbox” that contains 1,200 items, it is not an inbox.

It’s a landfill with a nicer name.

Try splitting it into:

- **Inbox (Today)** — allowed to be messy
- **Holding** — stuff you might want
- **Reference** — stuff you *know* you want

Then set a rule: *Inbox (Today) must be empty by tomorrow.*

Is this a perfect system? No. Is it a huge relief? Usually.

### Make a “default save location” real

A lot of computer stress is “I saved it somewhere. Probably.”

Pick one place where work-in-progress goes. Make it the default for downloads, screenshots, and drafts if you can. If not, at least make it the first folder your file picker shows.

Even if you still have a messy folder, it becomes **one messy folder**. That’s already an upgrade.

### Create one template you’ll actually reuse

Templates fail when they’re aspirational.

A template should be boring and helpful:

- “What is this?”
- “What’s next?”
- “Links”
- “Decisions”

If it takes more than five seconds to fill out, you won’t.

## The point: buy your future attention back

The best part of the 1% friction audit is that it changes what you notice.

You start seeing friction not as “this is my personality” (I’m just disorganized!) but as **an environmental bug** you can patch.

And once you fix one tiny thing, your brain gets a little evidence that improvement is normal—not an event that requires a new identity.

So here’s a low-stakes challenge for today:

**Find one repeated “ugh” and sand it down.**

Replace the wobbly chair with a stable one. Unsubscribe from the newsletter you never read. Rename the folder. Make the shortcut. Write the two-line template.

You don’t need a life overhaul.

You just need one fewer sharp edge.
